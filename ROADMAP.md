# Flux Roadmap

## Principles / constraints
- **Determinism first**: identical inputs should produce identical Render IR and outputs.
- **IR stability**: keep AST/Render IR shapes stable unless explicitly versioned.
- **Compatibility**: preserve v0.1 runtime behavior while evolving v0.2+ document rendering.

## Now
- TBD / Not yet implemented — no local issues or milestones are stored in the repo to infer active roadmap items.

## Next
- TBD / Not yet implemented — propose items via issues or discussions.

## Later
- TBD / Not yet implemented — propose items via issues or discussions.

## How to propose roadmap items
1. Open an issue describing the scope, user impact, and evidence from current docs/specs/tests.
2. Link to the relevant package or spec file where the gap appears.
3. Flag whether the change affects determinism, IR stability, or compatibility.
